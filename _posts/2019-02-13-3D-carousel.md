While working on other things, I discovered how performant it was to switch textures on an `SCNNode`. What if I could switch textures quickly, like at the speed of scroll? And thus, `ARPKCarousel` was born. 
*spoiler: it's plenty fast in a scrollview*

I like working with usdz files so I grabbed one off Apple's QuickLook Gallery and chucked it into a SCNView. Then underneath, I have a `UICollectionView` and the gist of it is whatever is at index 0 is the texture of the model. I added a few quality of life tweaks: 
- the `SCNView` is placed to hide the 'active' texture cell but not the label so you can get some context
- The `UICollectionView` has a large right contentInset to make sure the last cell can fit underneath slot 0
- I used a subclass of `UICollectionViewFlowLayout` to get the cells to snap to position 0 nicely (thanks to this SO post https://stackoverflow.com/a/49617263)

There could be a lot of other cool things to make this more useable but I'd like to move onto experiments on how this works in AR in future posts
