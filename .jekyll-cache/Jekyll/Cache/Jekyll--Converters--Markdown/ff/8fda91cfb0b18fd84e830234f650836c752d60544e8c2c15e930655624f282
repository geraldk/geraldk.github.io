I"ÿ	<p>When trying to make an inline configuration carousel, I realized while itâ€™s a great idea in a UIView, itâ€™s a dumb idea in AR.</p>

<p>So I was trying to recreate the experience in my <a href="https://arplaykit.com/experiments/2019/02/13/3D-carousel/">previous post</a> in AR. I drew a crappy picture to show what I was trying to accomplish</p>
<figure class="figure  figure--center">

<p>I realized that using the chair in the example would be very difficult as itâ€™s a big chair and where would I put the carousel? That should have given me a clue, ugh. I swapped out the model with a vase given in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/arkit/gallery/">Appleâ€™s Quick Look gallery</a> to try and make it a bit more manageable. I even implemented a custom UICollectionViewLayout to shrink non-focused cells (seen in the video below).</p>

<p>Alas, as I struggled with it, I eventually came to the conclusion that this wasnâ€™t going to work. Even with the shrinking cells, the carousel would need to be huge to fit the model. This is the vase on my desk in AR</p>

<p>In AR, realistic models like the chair and vase need to be real-world sizes and especially with a limited window of a phone screen, you canâ€™t expect a user to wave their phone around to see that a model has a carousel to change its color. That field of view will get bigger with AR glasses/goggles but even then, what if you were looking at a car? (Excuse my terrible Photoshop skills)</p>

<p>Your field of view would be about the green rectangle and the carousel could span the red rectangle on the ground. You canâ€™t be expected to swivel your head to see all the options in the carousel, configurations like this should be easy to view so you can choose your option quickly</p>

<p>I would still like to make a color picker â€˜attachedâ€™ to the model in 3D space instead of a 2D collectionView stuck in a corner. Hopefully I can get it right in the next post</p>
