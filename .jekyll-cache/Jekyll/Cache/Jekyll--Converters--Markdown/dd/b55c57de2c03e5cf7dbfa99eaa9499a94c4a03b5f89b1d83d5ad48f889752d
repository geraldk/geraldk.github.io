I"ø<p>My first post! Iâ€™m primarily a developer that works with UIKit in iOS and I would love to bring some of those elements into the 3D world that ARKit and SceneKit live in. Luckily, itâ€™s not that hard! Introducing: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UIViewControllerNode</code>. Itâ€™s a pretty simple concept, itâ€™s just a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCNNode</code> subclass with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SCNPlane</code> geometry that is textured with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UIViewController</code>â€™s view.</p>

<p><a class="button" href="https://github.com/geraldk/ARPKViewController">See it on GithubÂ  <svg width="16" height="16" class="icon  icon--github" role="img" alt="github"><title>github</title><use xlink:href="#github" fill="CurrentColor"></use></svg>
</a></p>

<p>A few extra bits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I added the option to have it billboarded so that the view is always visible</li>
  <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">viewController</code> parameter in the init is there so the node will retain the viewController for you. As long as you add it as a child of something or retain it in some other way, the viewController sticks around too</li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™m pretty surprised on how interactions work out of the box, you can scroll the tableView in my sample app, even if there are multiple of them. Sometimes itâ€™s a bit hard to scroll, I wonder if itâ€™s my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UITapGestureRecognizer</code> interfering with things or something is up with the hit-testing
I have a bunch of ideas on how to use this that Iâ€™ll be exploring in future posts. In the meantime, feel free to use it yourself!</p>
